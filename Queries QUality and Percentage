Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |

| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |

We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position. We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3. Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be round to 2 decimal places. Return the result table in any order.
solution:
select query_name, round(sum(rating/ position)/ count(query_name), 2) as quality,
round(avg(case when rating < 3 then 1 else 0 end)*100, 2)
as poor_query_percentage
from queries 
group by query_name
